👀🔍👮

[Panopticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon) allows a Thneed (a [Truffula](https://github.com/antiPhaseDomain/Silence project) to all browsers.

Running `npm start` will start a development server and saves all compiled files into `{Project Name}/assets/scripts/legacy/main.js`.

## Changing Projects 


Edit the [package.json](https://github.com/antiPhaseDomain/Panopticon/blob/master/package.json#L11) file and change both "build" and "serve" script runners to build and serve your project's folder. 

I'm pretty sure you can just add the filenames to `npm start`, but I have yet to try it out.
